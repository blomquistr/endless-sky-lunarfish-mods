# Endless Sky Lunarfish Mods

A collection of base game changes I've added for weird/fun/cheat-y ships (at least for now, maybe I'll try more stuff later?). Extending the base game [Endless Sky](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky) and using the [Starbridge Mod](https://github.com/blomquistr/Endless-Sky-Starbridge-Pack) by Autohummer as an example/guide because it was really basic and that seemed perfect for getting started.
